# TeamProfileGenerator

The objective was to use Node.js to create  a CLI which prompts the user to input information regarding members of their team. The generator then pushes the information into a joint html file. ÃŸ

Through this homework, got more comfortable using npm, async functions, Node.js, and 'fs'.
